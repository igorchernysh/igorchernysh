# Hi there üëã, I'm Igor Chernysh

I am an accomplished Infrastructure Engineer with over 20 years of experience specializing in the design, implementation, and management of robust IT infrastructures. My extensive background in database administration has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of database performance optimization, security, and high availability. Throughout my career, I have successfully led initiatives to modernize and scale infrastructure environments, leveraging technologies such as virtualization, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes). In addition to my infrastructure expertise, I have a strong foundation in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices. I have designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, enabling seamless and automated deployments. My SRE skills include proactive monitoring and incident management using tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Datadog, and ELK Stack, ensuring system reliability and performance. My proficiency in scripting and automation (Python, Ansible, Terraform, Perl) allows me to efficiently bridge the gap between infrastructure, DevOps, and data management, ensuring reliable and scalable solutions for complex technical challenges. My holistic approach to infrastructure engineering, combined with my DevOps and SRE expertise, enables me to drive continuous improvement and operational excellence in any organization.
